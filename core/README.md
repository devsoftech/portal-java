# Core
`portal-core` module provides API for the the users to construct a portal application and SPI for bridge modules to run a portal application on their environment.

Requires Java 6.

## Installing
Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.flowersinthesand</groupId>
    <artifactId>portal-core</artifactId>
    <version>${portal.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Application
A Portal application is a small bean container which contains beans defined by the user and beans used by the application. Here, the user can define a bean as a controller, service or repository, but the expected use case is to write a handler as a component of presentation layer.

For a declarative programming, a lot of annotations are provided and defined in the package `com.github.flowersinthesand.portal`.

```java
new App().init(new Options().url("/event"));
```

## Bean
Bean is an application component and is instantiated once per each application like singleton. Therefore, all declared fields on the bean must be thread-safe. The following bean names are reserved to be used internally by the application.

* `com.github.flowersinthesand.portal.spi.Dispatcher`
* `com.github.flowersinthesand.portal.spi.SocketManager`

### @Bean
* `String value() default ""`

Indicates that the annotated class is a bean. This annotation is required for all beans. The `value` element defines the bean name. If it is not provided, the bean name will be the class's name.

### @Wire
* `String value() default ""`

Marks the annotated field as to be wired. The `value` element indicates a bean name. If it exists, the container will find a bean by the name. Otherwise, the container will find a bean by the type of the field. The field does not need to be public.

Exceptionally, if the field type is `Room`, it will be wired regarding the value as the room name, even though it is not bean. If the corresponding room does not exist, it will be opened first before being wired.    

### @Prepare
Specifies that the annotated method should be be executed after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization. Only public methods with no arguments can be executed.

## Event handler
Any method annotated with `On` on any bean in the application is treated as event handler. According to the method signature, the following parameters will be provided.

* `Socket`: The socket instance that sent the event.

### @On
* `String value()`

Defines an annotated method or an annotated annotation as the event handler. The `value` element is an event name. The method should be `public` and a return type of the method signifies nothing. `On.open`, `On.message`, `On.close` are provided as special annotations for `open`, `message`, `close` event respectively.

### @Data
Specifies that the event data will be converted to the annotated parameter's type and set to the annotated parameter. By default, [Jackson](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) library is used to create an instance from a JSON string. Any object the client sent can be converted into the `Map<String, Object>` type.

### @Reply
Specifies that the annotated parameter is a reply callback. The parameter's type should be `Fn.Callback` or `Fn.Callback1`.

## Model 

### App

The App is the standalone application context.

* `static App find()`

Returns the first application from the default repository. Use this method only if there is a single application to avoid any ambiguousness.

* `static App find(String name)`

Finds an application which corresponds to the given name from the default repository. These methods are static, however, app intances are initialized and configured during runtime. So, only if each app's initialization is done, finder functions can work correctly.

* `App init(Options options)`
* `App init(Options options, Initializer initializer)`

Initializes the application.

* `App register()`

Registers the applicaton to the default repository.

* `String name()`

The application name. If the given options' name is null, the url will be the name.

* `Object get(String key)`

Returns a value bound with the specified key.

* `App set(String key, Object value)`

Binds a value to this application using the given key.

* `Room room(String name)`

Finds corresponding room or opens new one if it doesn't exist. Utilize this method when trying to access  rooms which are supposed to be created in runtime.

* `App fire(String event, Socket socket)`
* `App fire(String event, Socket socket, Object data)`
* `App fire(String event, Socket socket, Object data, Fn.Callback1<Object> reply)`

Fires the given event to the given socket with data and reply callback.

* `Object bean(String name)`
* `<T> T bean(Class<? super T> class)`

Returns the corresponding bean by name or type from the bean container.

### Options

* `String url()`
* `Options url(String url)`

The mapping url. This is required.

* `String name()`
* `Options name(String name)`

The application name.

* `Set<String> packages()`
* `Options packages(String... packageNames)`

Package names which will be scanned for beans.

* `Map<String, Object> beans()`
* `Object bean(String name)`
* `<T> T bean(Class<? super T> class)`
* `Options beans(String name, Object bean)`
* `Options beans(Object... beans)`

Beans to be stored to the application usually used for configuration.

### Room

The Room is where a group of opened sockets are staying under a specific concept in the real world. Always use a room instead of a socket when handling an entity. For example, a single user can correspond to a single room, but it cannot correspond to a single socket, because multiple sockets from other browsers or devices may indicate the same user simultaneously.

* `String name()`

The room's name.

* `Object get(String key)`

Returns a value bound with the specified key.

* `Room set(String key, Object value)`

Binds a value to this room using the given key.

* `Room add(Socket socket)`
* `Room add(Room room)`

Adds a socket or sockets in the given room. Only opened socket can be added, and duplicate addition is not possible on account of the Set semantics.

* `Room remove(Socket socket)`
* `Room remove(Room room)`

Removes a socket or sockets in the given room. If one of added sockets is closed, it will be removed from the room as well automatically. Use this method to exclude opened socket.

* `Room send(String event)`
* `Room send(String event, Object data)`

Sends an event with data to all sockets in the room.

* `Room close()`

Closes all the connections of the sockets.

* `Set<Socket> sockets()`

Returns a cloned set of the sockets contained in the room. Modification on the returned set is not allowed.

* `int size()`

The number of sockets.

* `Room delete()`

Clears all sockets and attributes and deletes the room from the application.

### Socket

The Socket is a physical bidirectional connectivity between the client and the server and also where the event occurs.

* `boolean opened()`

Whether the socket is opened or closed.

* `String param(String key)`

Getter for the `params` option in the client.

* `Socket send(String event)`
* `Socket send(String event, Object data)`
* `Socket send(String event, Object data, Fn.Callback callback)`
* `Socket send(String event, Object data, Fn.Callback1<A> callback)`

Sends an event with data and attaches a callback that takes data which will be sent by the client.

* `void close()`

Closes a connection.

### Fn

Amorphous functions.

#### Callback

* `void call()`

#### Callback1\<A\>

* `void call(A arg1)`
