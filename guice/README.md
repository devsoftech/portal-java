# Guice
`portal-guice` module delegates bean creation to the [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/). Therefore, Portal application can consist of Guice beans completely, and service or repository beans in Guice can be called by browser directly via the portal inversely. Guice bean is found by only the type of Portal bean, and if there is no matching bean, it will be created as usual.

## Installing
Add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.flowersinthesand</groupId>
    <artifactId>portal-guice</artifactId>
    <version>${portal.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Beans
 * `com.google.inject.Injector`

## Usage
### Definition
A bean to be managed by Guice and Portal should be declared as both Guice bean and Portal bean.

```java
@Bean
public class TwitterHandler {}
```

### Scope
When there are a single Guice bean container and multiple Portal applications, if a bean will be used by only a single application, its scope can be singleton. For the rest, it must be defined as prototype. In other words, handler beans which are subordinate to an application can be **singleton**, but SPI beans which are instantiated for each application such as Dispatcher and SocketManager must be **prototype**.
